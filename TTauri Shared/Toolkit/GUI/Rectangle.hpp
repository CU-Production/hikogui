/*! An description of a rectangle positioned somewhere on a parent rectangle.

 * The coordinate system has:
 * - increasing x toward the right.
 * - increasing y toward the bottom.
 *
 * Origin of a screen is the center of the left-top pixel.
 * Origin of a `Window` is the center of the left-top pixel.
 *
 * The `offset`, `size` and `origin` of a `Window` are in physicial screen pixels.
 *
 * Containers should only zoom out their child widgets. This means a child widget only
 * needs the DPI of the screen to calculate its size.
